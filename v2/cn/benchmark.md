# HelloWorld
Testing the performance of a HelloWorld server does not mean many things but
it does tell us where the ceiling is.

The HelloWorld server based on [OpenResty](openresty.html) is described in the
[GettingStarted](getting-started.html) document.

Below is the result using the command `ab -c10 -n50000 http://localhost:8080/` on
my ThinkPad T400 laptop with ngx_openresty 0.8.54.6:

```
Server Software:        ngx_openresty/0.8.54

```


So on my laptop, for a single nginx worker, we've got 20k+ r/s. For comparison,
HelloWorld servers using nginx + php-fpm 5.2.8 gives 4k r/s, Erlang R14B2 raw
gen_tcp server gives 8k r/s, and [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) v0.4.8 yields 5.7k
r/s.
