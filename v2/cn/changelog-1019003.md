# Version 1.19.3.1 - 25 Oct 2020

- upgraded the nginx core to 1.19.3.
	- see the changes here: https://nginx.org/en/CHANGES
- upgraded [ngx_lua](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#readme) to 0.10.18rc4.
    - feature: implemented the new tcpsok:setoption() function for setting options for the TCP socket. *Thanks poorsea for the patch.*
    - feature: added undocumented API for attaching arbitrary key-value pair data to a cosocket TCP connecton, which can survive connection pool reuse.
    - bugfix: `ngx.resp.get_headers()`: may return a wrong (like: negative) value of the Content-Length field when it is larger than 2^32. *Thanks LubinLew for the patch*.
    - bugfix: should still use timer instead of `delayed_events` when worker process is exiting, otherwise the new created 0 delay timer may have no chance to run. *Thanks Dejiang Zhu for the patch*.
    - optimize: added the "ev" to `ngx_posted_delayed_events` instead of the rbtree for 0 delay timer, so that we can save an epoll wait in such case. *Thanks syz for the patch*.
    - feature: implemented the new `ngx.ssl.server_port()` API to get server port. *Thanks Yan Zhu for the patch*.
    - bugfix: build error with nginx 1.7.4 or older version. *Thanks timebug for the patch*.
    - bugfix: we now only recycle light threads which are "entry threads" otherwise it is not safe to recycle user created threads since we have no idea whether the user may still hold refs to them.
    - optimize: now we make use of the new `lua_getexdata2` and `lua_setexdata2` to attach coctx to the Lua thread objects directly which save the lookup overhead which can become the bottleneck when there are many Lua light threads around in a single request handler.
    - feature: now we recycle lua thread GC objects for our "light threads" and added `lua_thread_cache_max_entries` directive to configure the cache size.
    - feature: added new C API `ngx_http_lua_pcre_version` to wrap the `pcre_version()` C API in libpcre.
    - bugfix: double values larger than `int32_t` were incorrectly printed out as 64-bit integers. *Thanks lijunlong for the patch*.
    - bugfix: the format in argerror messages are incorrect. *Thanks Alexander Drozdov for the patch*.
    - bugfix: when recreating balancer buffer, remove existing buffers first. *Thanks Datong Sun for the patch*.
    - bugfix: added missing SSL feature macro. *Thanks spacewander for the patch*.
    - feature: shared `ngx.ctx` among SSL_* phases and the following phases. *Thanks spacewander for the patch*.
    - feature(socket.tcp): enhance the logic of parameter verification in connect. *Thanks Jinhua Tan for the patch.*
    - bugfix: the body size may overflow since the size_t is only int32 in 32-bit system. *Thanks syz for the patch*.
    - feature: added the `ngx_http_lua_ffi_balancer_recreate_request` FFI function to allow recreation of request buffer in balancer phase. *Thanks Datong Sun for the patch*.
    - feature: add FFI interface to verify SSL client certificate. *Thanks ArchangelSDY for the patch*.
    - feature: added `exit_worker_by*` to run Lua code upon nginx worker process exit. *Thanks Jinhua Tan for the patch*.
    - optimize: avoided use of `lua_tolstring` in `ngx_http_lua_calc_strlen_in_table`, `ngx_http_lua_copy_str_in_table`, `ngx_http_lua_socket_udp_send`, `log_wrapper` and `ngx_http_lua_ngx_echo`. *Thanks lijunlong for the patch*.
    - bugfix: macro contains operator should be wrapped inside a bracket. *Thanks spacewander for the patch*.
    - feature: supported receiveany on `ngx.req.socket(true?)` socks. *Thanks Guy Lewin for the patch*.
    - refactor: used 'yieldable context' to simpify the context list. *Thanks spacewander for the patch*.
- upgraded [ngx_stream_lua](https://github.com/openresty/stream-lua-nginx-module#readme) to 0.0.9rc2.
    - feature: added the receiveany function for raw req socket. (#184) *Thanks tangsty for the patch*.
    - feature: implemented the new `ngx.ssl.server_port()` API to get server port. *Thanks Yan Zhu for the patch*.
    - feature: added new C API `ngx_stream_lua_pcre_version` to wrap the `pcre_version()` C API in libpcre.
    - bugfix: added missing SSL feature macro. *Thanks spacewander for the patch.*
    - feature: shared `ngx.ctx` among SSL_* phases and the following phases. *Thanks spacewander for the patch*.
    - bugfix: the stream subsystem was built incorrectly in debug mode. *Thanks spacewander for the patch*.
    - bugfix: hide get_request API in stream subsystem. *Thanks spacewander for the patch*.
    - feature: add FFI interface to verify SSL client certificate. *Thanks ArchangelSDY for the patch.*
- upgraded [lua-resty-core](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-core#readme) to v0.1.20rc3.
    - feature: implemented the new tcpsok:setoption() function for setting options for the TCP socket. *Thanks poorsea for the patch.*
    - feature: implemented the new `ngx.ssl.server_port()` API to get server port. *Thanks Yan Zhu for the patch.*
    - change: now we require `ngx_http_lua` 0.10.18 and `ngx_stream_lua` 0.0.9.
    - bugfix: `resty.core.regex` would fail to load silently on Windows. now we use `ngx_http_lua` or `ngx_stream_lua` modules' pcre version API wrapper to avoid such symbol exporting pains.
    - feature: shared `ngx.ctx` among SSL_* phases and the following phases. *Thanks spacewander for the patch.*
    - bugfix: added the missing 'ngx.req.start_time' to the stream subsystem. *Thanks Thibault Charbonnier for the patch.*
    - feature: add the `balancer.recreate_request` function, which allows user to recreate request buffer in balancer phase. *Thanks Datong Sun for the patch.*
- upgraded [lua-resty-mysql](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-mysql#readme) to 0.23rc1.

- upgraded [lua-resty-websocket](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-websocket#readme) to 0.08rc1.

    - change: resty: we no longer support arg[N] where N < 0.
    - bugfix: resty: the tmp directory has not been deleted. *Thanks Johnny for the patch.*
    - feature: resty: now we cache the original `ngx.say`/`ngx.print` functions into `ngx.orig_say` and `ngx.orig_print` since some times the user would need them.
