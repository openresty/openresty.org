# Binary Packages

OpenResty<sup>&reg;</sup> provides [official pre-built packages](linux-packages.html) for some of the common
Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, RHEL, Fedora, OpenSUSE, Alpine, and Amazon Linux).
Make sure you have checked out these binary packages first if you are on Linux.

We also provide pre-built Win32 packages for OpenResty<sup>&reg;</sup> on the [Download](download.html) page. And you should
also check out [this documentation](https://github.com/openresty/openresty/blob/master/doc/README-win32.md#readme) instead.

It is highly recommended to install OpenResty on our Mac OS X or macOS systems via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager, like this:

```bash
brew install openresty/brew/openresty
```

If you already installed OpenResty from `homebrew/nginx`, please run the following command first:

```bash
brew untap homebrew/nginx
```

# Building from Source

If you haven't downloaded the [OpenResty](openresty.html) source code tarball,
please go to the [Download](download.html) page first.

Basically, building and installing [OpenResty](openresty.html) is as simple
as

```bash
tar -xvf openresty-VERSION.tar.gz
cd openresty-VERSION/
./configure -j2
make -j2
sudo make install

# better also add the following line to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile file.
export PATH=/usr/local/openresty/bin:$PATH
```

where `VERSION` should be replaced by a concrete version number of [OpenResty](openresty.html),
like `1.11.2.5`.

You can add 3rd-party NGINX modules or enable other NGINX core features just like with the standard
NGINX distribution. For example, you can use the `--add-module=PATH` or `--add-dynamic-module=PATH` options
of OpenResty's `./configure` tool to insert 3rd-party NGINX C modules. But please note that 3rd-party NGINX C modules
not maintained by OpenResty are not supported by OpenResty and they *may* compromise OpenResty's stability.

You can use the command `./configure --help` to see all the available options that you can use to
enable and/or disable certain components or features of OpenResty during build time.

To start your OpenResty<sup>&reg;</sup>, you can just use the `openresty` command in place of your original `nginx`
command as long as you have correctly added the `<openresty-prefix>/bin/` directory to your system
environment `PATH` (`<openresty-prefix>` is default to `/usr/local/openresty/` unless being overridden
by `./configure`'s `--prefix=PATH` option).

You can also invoke the `resty` command-line utility to run a head-less OpenResty program
or the `restydoc` tool to browse OpenResty documentation on the terminal.

If your system environment is modern enough, then you almost always want to
enable the PCRE JIT support and IPv6 support in your NGINX by passing the `--with-pcre-jit` and
`--with-ipv6` options to the `./configure` script.

```bash
./configure --with-pcre-jit --with-ipv6
```

By default, OpenResty is installed into the prefix `/usr/local/openresty/`.

Finally, you need to add the command-line utilities provided by OpenResty to your
`PATH` environment, as in

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/openresty/bin:/usr/local/openresty/nginx/sbin:$PATH
```

if you are using bash. Better add this line to your shell's startup script, like `~/.bashrc`
or `~/.bash_profile`.

If you have problems while building or want finer control over the building
process, please read on.

## Prerequisites

You should have `perl 5.6.1+`, `libpcre`, `libssl` installed
into your system. For Linux, you should also ensure that `ldconfig` is in your
PATH environment.

### Debian and Ubuntu users

You're recommended to install the following packages using apt-get:

```bash
apt-get install libpcre3-dev \
    libssl-dev perl make build-essential curl
```

### Fedora and RedHat users

You're recommended to install the following packages using yum:

```bash
yum install pcre-devel openssl-devel gcc curl zlib-devel
```

### Mac OS X (macOS) users

It is highly recommended to install OpenResty on our Mac OS X or macOS systems via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager, like this:

```bash
brew install openresty/brew/openresty
```

If you already installed OpenResty from `homebrew/nginx`, please run the following command first:

```bash
brew untap homebrew/nginx
```

You're recommended to install prerequisites PCRE and OpenSSL using some package
management tool, like [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/):

```bash
brew update
brew install pcre openssl curl
```

Alternatively you can install PCRE and/or OpenSSL from source all by yourself
:)

After installing PCRE and OpenSSL, you may need to specify the paths for their
headers and libraries to your C compiler and linker, for example,

```bash
$ ./configure \
   --with-cc-opt="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include/ -I/usr/local/opt/pcre/include/" \
   --with-ld-opt="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/ -L/usr/local/opt/pcre/lib/" \
   -j8
```

assuming that your PCRE and OpenSSL are installed under the prefix `/usr/local/opt/` which
is the default for homebrew.

See also [Issue #3](https://github.com/agentzh/openresty/issues/3).

## FreeBSD users

You need to install the following ports:
* devel/gmake
* security/openssl
* devel/pcre

## Building OpenResty

### Download

download the latest openresty tarball can be fetched from the [Download](download.html) page
and unpack it like this:

```bash
tar -xzvf openresty-VERSION.tar.gz
```

where `VERSION` should be replaced by real version numbers like `1.11.2.5`.

### ./configure

Then enter the `openresty-VERSION/` directory, and type the following command
to configure:

```bash
./configure
```

By default, `--prefix=/usr/local/openresty` is assumed. You should only disable
[LuaJIT](luajit.html) 2 when your platform does not support [LuaJIT](luajit.html).

You can specify various options, as in

```bash
./configure --prefix=/opt/openresty \
            --with-pcre-jit \
            --with-ipv6 \
            --without-http_redis2_module \
            --with-http_iconv_module \
            --with-http_postgres_module \
            -j8
```

All of the standard [Nginx](nginx.html) configure file options can be used here,
including `--add-module=PATH` for adding your own 3rd-party [Nginx](nginx.html) C
modules. Try `./configure --help` to see more options available.

Errors in running the ./configure script can be found in the file `build/nginx-VERSION/objs/autoconf.err` where
`VERSION` should be replaced by a concrete version number of [OpenResty](openresty.html),
like `1.11.2.5`.

#### Notes for Solaris users

For Solaris, it's common to install libraries like OpenSSL to `/lib`, so when
it complaints about missing OpenSSL and you have indeed already installed it,
specify the `--with-ld-opt='-L/lib'` option.

### make

Now you can compile everything up using the command

```bash
make
```

If your machine has multiple cores and your `make` supports the jobserver feature,
you can compile things in parallel like this:

```bash
make -j2
```

assuming you have 2 CPU cores.

### make install

If all the previous steps go without problems, you can install [OpenResty](openresty.html) into
your system by typing the command

```bash
make install
```

On Linux, it often requires `sudo` to gain root access.

If you prefer building the OpenSSL and PCRE dependencies from their source tarballs,
then you could follow the commands below (you may want to change the version
number accordingly):

```bash
wget https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.2k.tar.gz
tar -zvxf openssl-1.0.2k.tar.gz
cd openssl-1.0.2k/
patch -p1 < /path/to/openresty/patches/openssl-1.0.2h-sess_set_get_cb_yield.patch
cd ..

wget ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/pcre-8.40.tar.gz
tar -xvf pcre-8.40.tar.gz

wget https://openresty.org/download/openresty-1.11.2.5.tar.gz
tar -zxvf openresty-1.11.2.5.tar.gz
cd openresty-1.11.2.5/

## assuming your have 4 spare logical CPU cores

./configure --with-openssl=../openssl-1.0.2k \
                 --with-pcre=../pcre-8.40 -j4
make -j8
sudo make install
```
