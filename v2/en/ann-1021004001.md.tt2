We are happy to announce the new formal release, [% version %], of the
OpenResty web platform based on NGINX and LuaJIT.

[Download this version here](download.html).

The (portable) source code distribution, the Win32/Win64 binary
distributions, and the pre-built binary Linux packages for Ubuntu,
Debian, Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, Alpine, OpenSUSE, Amazon Linux, Rocky Linux,
and Oracle Linux are provided on this [Download page](download.html).

# Version Highlights

* Based on a very recent mainline [NGINX](nginx.html) core [% major_ver %].
* [LuaJIT](https://github.com/openresty/luajit2#readme)
    * Now we can fully JIT compile Lua loops for iterating through Lua hash tables, i.e., for k, v in pairs(tb) do â€¦ end and other related forms. This work sponsored by OpenResty INC.
    * Implemented a new string.buffer API.
    * Fixed the bug that Lua table iteration terminates early.
    * Many fixes imported from Mike Pall's upstream https://github.com/luajit/luajit repository.
* Implemented the new [ngx.run_worker_thread](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxrun_worker_thread) API to run Lua function in a seperated worker thread.
* Added [lua_ssl_conf_command](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_ssl_conf_command) directive for setting arbitrary OpenSSL configuration parameter particularly the TLSv1.3 ciphersuites.
* Added [ssl_client_hello_by_lua*](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ssl_client_hello_by_lua_block) api for controlling the [NGINX](nginx.html) downstream SSL handshake dynamically with Lua.
* Added support for BoringSSL.
* Fixed the bug that posted event handler is called after the event is freed.
* Fixed pending [ngx.pipe](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-core/blob/master/lib/ngx/pipe.md#readme) until timeout caused by pipe that forgot to close in child process.
* [lua-resty-redis](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-redis#readme) module
    * Added a surface to support redis module.
* Upgraded OpenSSL to 1.1.1n for Win32/Win64.
