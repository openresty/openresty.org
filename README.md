Description
===========

This repository holds the source code and configurations for the [official OpenResty site](https://openresty.org/).

This site is a dynamic web application built entirely upon the OpenResty stack, backed by the [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)
database management system.

The latest generation of this site is under the `v2/` directory of this repository.

Building
========

You need to install both OpenResty and [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) 9.x, obviously.

You need to install [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), [marked](https://marked.js.org/), [cheerio](http://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio), [axios](https://www.axios.com/), [pug](https://pugjs.org) and [sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) to your system.
On Mac OS X, for example, it's as simple as

```bash
brew install pandoc
npm install marked cheerio axios pug sharp
```

You'll also need `perl` installed in your system for building the web site (not needed for serivce deployment though).

```bash
cd v2/

make gendata  # generate data files from .md files

# create the test database "openresty_org" and the test account "openresty" in your local PostgreSQL server.
# using commands in the initial comment lines of the init.sql file.
# for example:
psql -Upostgres    # or "psql postgres", depending on your Pg installation
# postgres=# create user openresty with password 'speedtheweb';
# postgres=# create database openresty_org;
# postgres=# grant all privileges on database openresty_org to openresty;

make initdb   # create the database and load the data files
make run      # starting the test nginx server listened on localhost:8080
make reload   # for reloading the test nginx server
```

If your machine has more than one spare CPU cores, then you can specify the `-jN` option of `make` to build the HTML
docs in parallel, as in

```bash
make gendata -j8
```

This command will run the build in 8 parallel jobs, thus utilizing 8 CPU cores at most.

If you want to re-generate the `openresty_org.templates` Lua module from the TT2 template files under `templates/`, then
you need to install the [Lemplate](https://metacpan.org/pod/Lemplate) CPAN module like this:

```bash
sudo cpan Lemplate
```

and then just run

```bash
make
```

The `.po` files under `po/` are for I18N (we need to support both the English and Chinese versions of this site, at least).
These files are similar to the `.po` files used by the classic [GNU gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) toolchain,
but we do not use `GNU gettext` at all.  Our `.po` files would be automatically updated according to the latest Lua source
and TT2 template files with this command as well. If you make any edits to the `.po` files, then remember to re-run the
`make` command to make your changes take effect (by updating the `openresty_org.i18n` Lua module file from the `.po` files).

If you want to update the list of blog posts, then you need to run:

```bash
make auto-templates
```

This command also downloads images from our blog site, compress these images and save them to /v2/images/header-images.

OpenResty Release
=================

When you are ready to release a new version of openresty, then you need to manually update the following files:

  - v2/cn/ann-1027001002.md.tt2
  - v2/cn/changelog-1027002.md
  - v2/cn/download.md.tt2
  - v2/en/ann-1027001002.md.tt2
  - v2/en/changelog-1027002.md
  - v2/en/download.md.tt2
  - v2/templates/news-cn.tt2
  - v2/templates/news-en.tt2
  - v2/util/news.pug

After that, run the following commands to generate the new version of the site:

```bash
make clean
make
```

TODO
====

* Add responsive design to the web page templates for mobile devices with small screens.
* Add a in-memory caching layer to the openresty_org web app via [lua-resty-lrucache](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-lrucache)
and/or [lua_shared_dict](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_shared_dict).
* Translate more English `.md` documents into Chinese.
* Add a pager to the search result page in the `openresty_org` web app.
* Add an RSS feed endpoint in the `openresty_org` web app.
* Add another tab page to the right-hand side-bar of the web pages featuring the top N hot pages.
* Add an OpenResty logo to the web page header.
* Remove the dependency on `pandoc` by migrating to a standalone Perl script.
